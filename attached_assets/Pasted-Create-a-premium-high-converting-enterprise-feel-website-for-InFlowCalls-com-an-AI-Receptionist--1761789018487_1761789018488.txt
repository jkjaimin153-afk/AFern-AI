Create a premium, high-converting, enterprise-feel website for InFlowCalls.com, an AI Receptionist + Outbound Caller product for SMBs and mid-market customers. The site must be visually elegant, modern, and corporate-luxury: navy-blue + black primary palette, bright accent color for CTAs (electric teal or bright cyan), lots of negative space, 2xl rounded cards, soft shadows, and premium typography (serif headline + clean geometric sans for body). The site must feel higher-end than common competitors: polished animations, micro-interactions, and subtle motion — but fast and accessible.

Style tone: confident, clear, slightly conversational for SMB pages, more formal for enterprise technical pages. Every single piece of copy should be original and conversion-focused. Do not publish any actual pricing yet — show zeros in numeric fields.

Global site settings

Domain: InFlowCalls.com. Use site title “InFlowCalls — AI Receptionist & Calling”.

Favicon: minimal monogram “IC” in navy on black or inverse.

Primary colors: Navy (#0b2340), Rich Black (#000000), Accent cyan (#00e0ff). Neutral greys for text.

Fonts: Playfair Display (or other elegant serif) for headings; Inter or Montserrat for body. Use large hero type (60–72px desktop).

Layout: responsive, grid-based, 1200–1400px max content width, 24px gutter.

Microcopy for accessibility: alt text for all images, aria labels for all buttons and forms.

Animations: hero fade + parallax, subtle card hover (scale 1.02), CTA micro-shake on hover. Keep animations performant (prefers-reduced-motion respected).

Imagery: high-quality lifestyle photography (people on phones, boutique hotels, small-business storefronts, field technicians). Use abstract AI waveforms and stylized phone icons as background art.

Logo: premium wordmark + minimal icon (phone waveform + incoming arrow). Provide SVG and PNG with transparent background and navy/black variants.

Required pages & exact content blocks

Produce the following pages and blocks in order. For each block create original copy, heading hierarchy (H1/H2/H3), calls-to-action, and suggested micro-interactions.

1) Home (Landing / Hero)

Exact copy snippets (paste-ready)

Include the following ready-to-paste copy blocks in the design:

Hero CTA microcopy:

Primary CTA: “Request a 5-Min Demo”

Secondary CTA: “Listen to demo call”

Feature snippets (one-liners):

NLU: “Understands caller intent, context, and urgency — so the right action happens every time.”

Scheduling: “Two-way calendar sync — prevent double bookings and auto-confirm in real time.”

Payments: “Accept deposits and payments on the call with PCI-compliant flows.”

Sample inbound call script (for Home Services):

AI: “Thanks for calling QuickFix Plumbing, this is InFlow — how can I help today?”

Caller: “I have a burst pipe in the kitchen.”

AI: “I’m sorry to hear that. Is anyone in immediate danger or is the leak contained?”

Caller: “No danger, just lots of water.”

AI: “I can book an emergency visit. What’s the address and preferred time — morning or afternoon?”

(then capture address, preferred time, create ticket in ServiceTitan, send confirmation text)

Sample outbound reminder script:

AI: “Hi, this is InFlow for Deerfield Inn. This is a reminder of your 2PM check-in on Oct 0. Reply ‘YES’ to confirm or press 1 to change your reservation.”

FAQ starter Qs:

“How accurate is the AI?” — short answer: “Our AI handles X% of routine calls; human fallback available.” (use X as placeholder)

“Do you integrate with my PMS/CRM?” — “We integrate natively with common systems and via Zapier for everything else.”

Legal microcopy:

Privacy: “We encrypt recordings in transit and at rest. HIPAA BAA available on request.”

Terms: short user agreement summary and link to full TOS.

Visual & UX requirements (exact)

Navigation: sticky nav with 8–10px shadow. CTA on right.

Use a “request demo” floating button bottom-right (persistent).

Use customer-portal login (top-right).

Implement light/dark toggle but default to dark/navy theme.

Provide 3 hero variations for A/B testing: (1) product-led, (2) industry-led, (3) ROI-led (numbers).

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard nav, skip-to-content link, semantic HTML.

SEO / Metadata / Schema

Create unique meta title and description for each page; supply 5–7 target keywords for SEO and a 150–160 char meta description for home page.

Home meta title: “InFlowCalls — AI Receptionist & Outbound Calling for Small Business”

Home meta description: “InFlowCalls automates call answering, booking and outbound reminders — integrated to CRMs, calendars and PMSs. HIPAA-ready options.”

Add JSON-LD for Organization, WebSite, Product, and BreadcrumbList.

Create XML sitemap and robots.txt.

Analytics, Tracking & Marketing

Install Google Tag Manager + GTM container stub, Google Analytics 4 event suggestions (demo button clicks, audio plays, integration clicks, pricing view).

Add Hotjar or similar session replay snippet option.

Add Mailchimp / Klaviyo newsletter form integration.

Add pixel stubs for LinkedIn and Facebook.

Performance & Dev notes (deliverable-ready)

Frontend: React (Next.js) or static JAMstack (preferred Next.js for SSR + SEO).

CSS: TailwindCSS recommended; provide a Tailwind config with navy/black/cyan tokens.

Images: use responsive images (srcset), lazy-load offscreen images.

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify recommended; CDN for assets, automated HTTPS.

Telephony: use Twilio programmable voice or SIP trunking; expose SIP settings in admin.

Database & backend: PostgreSQL for events, S3 for recordings, Redis for job queue.

Infrastructure: Dockerized services, CI/CD, automated backups, monitoring (Prometheus / Grafana).

Provide an admin panel wireframe: dashboard, call logs, transcripts, integration settings, billing settings.

Provide deployment checklists and runbook for incident responses (e.g., telephony outage).

Marketing assets to generate

Produce these assets (placeholders okay) and wire them into the site:

4 demo audio files (wav/mp3) + transcripts.

6 hero-processed images (hotel, plumber, salon, law firm, clinic, ecommerce).

3 explainer videos (30–60s) — hero, how-it-works, integrations.

Downloadable PDFs: Security Whitepaper, HIPAA Info Sheet, Quick Start Guide.

Onsite conversion flows & CTAs

Demo request → Calendly/Google Calendar integrated scheduling with time-zone detection.

“Try a Live Demo” → open a sandbox phone number that plays real demo flows (if possible).

Contact form: name, business, phone, website, industry (dropdown), integrations (multi-select).

Sales lead scoring: mark requests from specific industries as high-priority.

Unique differentiation instructions (make it not like competitors)

Avoid generic stock hero images of call centers. Use intimate business photography (owner on phone, hotel concierge).

Hero must include audible demo (users can hear how it sounds — competitors sometimes hide audio).

Offer “vertical playbook” snapshots on the home page (tiny cards showing a one-sentence playbook for each industry) — this will feel specialized vs. “general” competitors.

Emphasize “fast install” (24–72 hours) in copy and a “Setup time estimator” on the checkout/demo flow.

Provide a clear “human fallback” option in pricing and pages — many competitors bury this or charge separately. Make it visible.

Provide an ROI calculator that uses real business math (lost leads → recovered revenue) with shareable results.

Final builder instructions

Write all text in clear, persuasive English. No lorem ipsum.

Use headings and subheadings exactly as specified above.

Replace all numeric results, pricing and KPI displayed numbers with 0 placeholders and include a subtle label “(pricing temporarily hidden)”.

When referencing competitor content for ideas, do not copy. Produce new phrasing and unique examples.

Deliver final website as:

Fully rendered HTML/CSS/JS site (or Next.js codebase).

A style guide (colors, typography, component list).

Content inventory (CSV/Excel) with all copy, image alt text, meta tags, and demo audio transcripts.

A deployment README with API keys/integration steps, and a checklist to remove the 0 placeholders once pricing is decided.
